### 3. Smart Grid Security: A Machine Learning Perspective
**by Prof. Paul Yoo (Birkbeck College, University of London, England)** <br/>
**Time: 15:20 ~ 16:10, June 10, 2022** <br/>  
> <img src="images\yoo.png" width="300" /> <br/>
> * Abstract: This talk covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of securing smart grid using machine learning with particular focus on false data injection (FDI). FDI attacks are malicious insertions of false data as sensor measurements (targeting the interface rather than the computational/network components) in a cyber physical system, in order to lead the system to take a wrong action. Due to the rapid growth of the Internet and associated complex pervasive systems, cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated, other domains such as finance, healthcare, finance, manufacturing and defence have also been exploited with similar malicious actions and thus FDI has become one of the top-priority issues to deal with today. In this talk, we discuss the impact of FDI in critical domains like smart grid and its countermeasures, and introduce machine learning based methodologies on how to defend smart grid from such attacks. 
> * Short Bio: Dr Paul Yoo is currently Associate Professor (SL) in Data Analytics in the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems and the Deputy Director for Knowledge Exchange in the Birkbeck Institute for Data Analytics (BIDA), University of London, UK. Prior to this, he held academic/research posts in Cranfield (Defence Academy of the UK), Sydney (USyd) and South Korea (KAIST). He trained originally as a data scientist with degrees from the University of Sydney, Australia. In his career, he has amassed more than ninety prestigious journal and conference publications, has been awarded more than US$ 2.3 million in project funding, and a number of prestigious international and national awards for his work in advanced data analytics, machine learning and secure systems research, notably IEEE Outstanding Leadership Award, Rozetta Award (f.k.a CMCRC), Emirates Foundation Research Award, and the ICT Fund Award. Most recently, he won the prestigious Samsung award for research to protect IoT devices using machine-learning approach and Research England’s Global Challenge Research Fund (GCRF). Paul currently serves as an Associate Editor for ACM Computing Surveys, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing and IEEE Access. He had served as an Editor for IEEE COMML(big data and machine learning areas) from 2014 to 2019.
